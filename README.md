# Data-Science-Meetup-11-8-18-Materials
Data set and R code for the 11/8/18 Data Science meetup presentation

"ECLSK.dat": subset of 6K children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Kindergarten cohort 1998-1999. The full data set and information on the variables is publicly available at https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/kindergarten.asp.

"Example ECLSK.R": R code to fit trees, cross-validated trees, and random forests on the ECLSK.dat data set.

This is a fork of an original repo from Gabriela Stegmann https://github.com/gabistegmann/Data-Science-Meetup-11-8-18-Materials
I made this so I could move the R code into a Jupyter Notebook with an R Kernel and play with the code to learn more about it.
